BANK LOAN REPORT: SUMMARY
KPI’s
Total loan applications
Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specific period. Customer ID is a unique identifying factor; the customer ID count = the number of loan applications
SELECT COUNT(id) AS total_loan_applications
FROM financial_loan_data
 
Purpose: Loan ID is a unique identifier assigned to each loan application or loan account. It serves as a primary key for tracking and managing individual loans. Use for Banks: Banks use Loan IDs to efficiently manage and track loans throughout their lifecycle. It aids in organizing loan records, monitoring repayments, and addressing customer inquiries.
PMTD loan applications
Monitor the month to date (MTD) loan applications to track the MoM (month-over-month) changes. Previous MTD (PMTD) applications tells us how man applications were received during the previous month (November).
SELECT COUNT(id) AS total_applications 
FROM financial_loan_data
WHERE MONTH(issue_date) = 11
 
------
Total funded amount	
Understand the total amount of funds disbursed as loans. Monitor the MTD total funded amount and analyze the MoM changes.
SELECT SUM(loan_amount) AS total_funded_amount
FROM financial_loan_data

 
MTD funded amount
Analyze month-to-date (MTD) total amount received and observe the MoM changes using PMTD.

SELECT SUM(loan_amount) AS total_funded_amount
FROM financial_loan_data
WHERE MONTH(issue_date) = 12
 
PMTD funded amount
SELECT SUM(loan_amount) AS previous_total_funded_amount
FROM financial_loan_data
WHERE MONTH(issue_date) = 11
 
Total amount received
Track the total amount received from the borrowers (assess the bank’s cash flow and loan repayment). Analyze month-to-date (MTD) total amount received and observe the MoM changes.
SELECT SUM(total_payment) AS total_amount_received
FROM financial_loan_data
 
MTD amount received
SELECT SUM(total_payment) AS MTD_total_amount_received
FROM financial_loan_data
WHERE MONTH(issue_date) = 12
 
PMTD amount received
SELECT SUM(total_payment) AS PMTD_total_amount_received
FROM financial_loan_data
WHERE MONTH(issue_date) = 11

 
------
Average interest rate across loans
Calculate average interest rates cross all loans, MTD, and MoM variations in interest rates (provides insights into overall cost of lending portfolio).
SELECT ROUND(AVG(int_rate), 4) * 100 AS avg_interest_rate
FROM financial_loan_data
 
Purpose: Interest Rate represents the annual cost of borrowing expressed as a percentage. It determines the loan's cost. Use for Banks: Banks use interest rates to price loans, manage profit margins, and attract investors.
MTD average interest rate
SELECT ROUND(AVG(int_rate), 4) * 100 AS MTD_avg_interest_rate
FROM financial_loan_data
WHERE MONTH(issue_date) = 12 AND YEAR(issue_date) = 2021
 
PMTD average interest rate
SELECT ROUND(AVG(int_rate), 4) * 100 AS PMTD_avg_interest_rate
FROM financial_loan_data
WHERE MONTH(issue_date) = 11 AND YEAR(issue_date) = 2021
 
Average DTI across loans
Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers to gauge their financial health. Calculate average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track MoM fluctuations.
SELECT ROUND(AVG(dti), 4) * 100 AS avg_DTI
FROM financial_loan_data
 
Purpose: DTI measures the borrower's debt burden relative to income. It gauges the borrower's capacity to take on additional debt. Use for Banks: Banks use DTI to assess a borrower's ability to handle loan payments and make responsible lending decisions.
MTD average DTI across loans
SELECT ROUND(AVG(dti), 4) * 100 AS MTD_avg_DTI
FROM financial_loan_data
WHERE MONTH(issue_date) = 12 AND YEAR(issue_date) = 2021
 
PMTD average DTI across loans
SELECT ROUND(AVG(dti), 4) * 100 AS PMTD_avg_DTI
FROM financial_loan_data
WHERE MONTH(issue_date) = 11 AND YEAR(issue_date) = 2021

	/
	COUNT(id) AS good_loan_percentage
FROM financial_loan_data

	(COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'Charged Off' THEN id END) * 100) 
	/
	COUNT(id) AS good_loan_percentage
FROM financial_loan_data

Loan status grid view

Function: gain a comprehensive overview of lending operations and monitor the performance of loans by creating a grid view repot categorized by ‘loan status’. Metrics such as total loan applications, total funded amount, total amount received, MTD funded amount, MTD amount received, average interest rate, and average DTI ratio provide insight into the health of the loan portfolio and empowers us to make data-driven decisions

	SUM(loan_amount) AS total_funded_amount,
	SUM(total_payment) AS total_received_amount
FROM financial_loan_data
GROUP BY MONTH(issue_date), DATENAME(MONTH, issue_date)
ORDER BY MONTH(issue_date)

	SUM(loan_amount) AS total_funded_amount,
	SUM(total_payment) AS total_received_amount
FROM financial_loan_data
GROUP BY address_state
ORDER BY address_state
 
 
Purpose: Address State indicates the borrower's location. It helps in assessing regional risk factors, compliance with state regulations, and estimating default probabilities. Use for Banks: Banks use this information to identify regional trends in loan demand, adjust marketing strategies, and manage risk portfolios based on geographic regions.

	COUNT(id) AS total_loan_applications,
	SUM(loan_amount) AS total_funded_amount,
	SUM(total_payment) AS total_received_amount
FROM financial_loan_data
GROUP BY term
ORDER BY term
 
Purpose: Term defines the duration of the loan in months. It sets the repayment period. Use for Banks: Banks use the term to structure loan agreements, calculate interest payments, and manage loan maturities.
Employee Length

SELECT
